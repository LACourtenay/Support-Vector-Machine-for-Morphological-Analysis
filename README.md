<b> Courtenay (2019) Support Vector Machine for Morphological Analysis

<i> Support Vector Machines (SVM) are powerful Machine Learning algorithms that can provide efficient and high performing classifications 
of complex data sets. Here lies R-Code that can be used to process morphological data using SVMs that have been able to achieve 100%
classification rates in some practical cases </b> </i>

This code has been designed for the open-access free R software. This is easy to use by simply executing each line of code within the R shell. 

<b> No additional formatting of the actual code should be needed. </b>

For geometric morphometric data, the file containing landmark coordinates should be in the standard <b> morphologika </b> format.
For metric data, the data is simply required to be saved in a .csv (comma delimited) file format.
For ease of the analyst, and in order for this code to work, the labels for your data <i> have </i> to be named "Sample". This is applicable both to the morphologika as well as the csv file. For an example of the format of data sets, please consult the corresponding files at:
